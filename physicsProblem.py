#Speed - is a scalar quantity that refers to "how fast an object is moving."
#Velocity - is a vector quantity that refers to "the rate at which an object changes its position."
#For example someone walking in a circle around a point would have a higher speed than their velocity
#Because they are moving quickly without going very far

#Avg speed = distanceTraveled/time
#Avg Velocity = displacement/time


#Instantaneous Speed - the speed at any given instant in time.
#Average Speed - the average of all instantaneous speeds; found simply by a distance/time ratio.
